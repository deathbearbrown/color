# Color

I am working on some code to convert RYB to RGB using this paper:
<http://vis.computer.org/vis2004/DVD/infovis/papers/gossett.pdf>

I also am trying to add formulas to calculate:
 - compliments
 - split compliments
 - triads
 - analogous
 - tetradic

 I'm taking a painting class currently and am trying to add the formulas as we work through them in class.
